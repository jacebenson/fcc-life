# Game of life

This project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-the-game-of-life).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story: When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
1. User Story: I can start and stop the board.
1. User Story: I can set up the board.
1. User Story: I can clear the board.
1. User Story: When I press start, the game will play out.
1. User Story: Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Nodejs
- Git

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone the repo, `https://gitlab.com/jacebenson/fcc-life.git`
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/jacebenson/fcc-life.git
```

Install the required dependencies
```
cd fcc-life
npm install
```

To get this repo hosting I've included a npm script to spin up a server with this command;
```
npm run start #stands up a local server
npm run build #builds self contained build folder
```

## Development

## Deployment

This deploy's to gitlab today with gitlab pages.
So all that's needed is the content of the page needs to exist in `/public`.
